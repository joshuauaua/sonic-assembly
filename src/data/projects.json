We were tasked with providing sound design and final mixing across all video formats. The challenge was to craft a sonic experience that supported the visuals and storytelling without overshadowing the music being created. We designed a palette of custom sound effects—subtle whooshes, impacts, and UI-style accents—created via foley and synthesis. Each element was carefully placed to match the visual rhythm while leaving space for dialogue and the musical arc.",
      "result": "The project was delivered in multiple versions, including a 6+ minute documentary and shorter social cuts, successfully enhancing the narrative without competing with the star audio. Released across Google and Google Deepminds official platforms accounts with over 500,000 views and counting"
